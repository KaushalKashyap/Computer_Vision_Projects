from both algorithms a common file needed is haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml.
It is nothing but just a pre-trained model to detect face from image and match it with Other feed (either image or camera feed)...
Make sure that you have the "haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml" file in the same directory where your python execution file exist.
